# Invisibility-Cloak

If you are a Harry Potter fan like me, you would know what an Invisibility Cloak is. Yes! It’s the cloak which Harry Potter uses to become invisible. Of course, we all know that an invisibility cloak is not real — it’s all graphics trickery.

In this notebook, we will learn how to create our own **Invisibility Cloak** using simple computer vision techniques in OpenCV.
